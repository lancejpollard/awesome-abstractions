# Awesome Abstractions

The objective of this project is to curate the best abstractions out there in various categories. It has taken thousands if not millions of people hours to land on the abstractions we currently have in software, so it would be significant to capture these down.

Each category first lists the types of topics you might look for abstractions in, within that category. Then it lists the libraries and projects which implement these abstractions. Potentially we could include some notes on some key insights you found when learning about the project, but not entirely necessary.

This is really mostly for imperative style languages (C, Rust, JavaScript, Go, etc.), but other languages are welcome too (Haskell, Coq, Assembly, etc.).

## HTTP Abstractions

- Abstractions over HTTP 1, 1.1, and 2.

Found in:

- **Node.js**. It creates APIs for both HTTP 1 and 2, and it tries to keep them compatible, even though HTTP 2 has features not used by HTTP 1.

## Network Abstractions

- Abstractions over TCP, UDP, HTTP perhaps.

Found in:

- **Node.js**.

## File Abstractions

- File permissions / access control abstractions cross-platform.

Found in:

- **Node.js**.
